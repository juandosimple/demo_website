                      proprietor of such marketplace (each a “Proprietor”), and that
                      Proprietor has no responsibility for the Sourced Mobile Software or
                      content thereof. Your use of the Sourced Mobile Software must comply
                      with the applicable terms of service for the marketplace from which
                      you downloaded the Sourced Mobile Software. You acknowledge that
                      Proprietor has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance
                      and support services with respect to the Sourced Mobile Software. In
                      the event of any failure of the Sourced Mobile Software to conform
                      to any applicable warranty, you may notify Proprietor, and
                      Proprietor will refund the purchase price for the Sourced Mobile
                      Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
                      Proprietor will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with

                      losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any
                      failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this
                      Agreement and any law applicable to Tapybl as a provider of the

                      addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the
                      Sourced Mobile Software or your possession and/or use of the Sourced

                      liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Sourced Mobile Software
                      fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement;
                      and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar

                      software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party
                      claim that the Sourced Mobile Software or your possession and use of
                      that Sourced Mobile Software infringes that third party’s
                      intellectual property rights, Tapybl, not Proprietor, will be solely
                      responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge
                      of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent
                      required by this Agreement. You and Tapybl acknowledge and agree
                      that Proprietor, and Proprietor’s subsidiaries, are third-party
                      beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the
                      Sourced Mobile Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms
                      and conditions of this Agreement, Proprietor will have the right
                      (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this
                      Agreement as relates to your license of the Sourced Mobile Software

                          SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE
                          THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK
                          RELIEF FROM TAPYBL. If you are domiciled in a country for which
                          arbitration is designated as the exclusive forum for dispute
                          resolution, then you agree to first contact us at
                          <u>info@Tapybl.com</u> and attempt to resolve the dispute with
                          us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able
                          to resolve a dispute you have with us after sixty (60) days, we
                          each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy
                          (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief
                          as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or
                          relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach
                          thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration. Any
                          judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
                          in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section
                          shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or
                          other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent
                          the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
                          violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or
                          other proprietary rights by arbitration.

                          Class Action / Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS
                          AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED
                          THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL
                          CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND

                          NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT,
                          BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND TAPYBL ARE EACH WAIVING
                          THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS

                      assigned by Tapybl without restriction. Any attempted transfer or

                      Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement. Tapybl may
                      provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by

                      via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of
                      such notice on our website, as determined by Tapybl in our sole
                      discretion. Tapybl reserves the right to determine the form and
                      means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may
                      opt out of certain means of notification as described in this
                      Agreement. Tapybl is not responsible for any automatic filtering you
                      or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to

                      discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and
                      so you should review this page periodically. When we change the
                      Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’
                      date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service
                      after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms
                      of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future
                      Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the

                      Entire Agreement / Severability. This Agreement, together with any
                      amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with
                      Tapybl in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire
                      agreement between you and Tapybl concerning the Service. In the
                      event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following
                      documents, the order of precedence shall be (1) the applicable Order
                      Form, (2) any additional terms or addenda applicable to specific
                      versions of the Service, and (3) this Agreement. If any provision of
                      this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent
                      jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the
                      validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall
                      remain in full force and effect.

                    <li>
                      No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a

                      Tapybl’s failure to assert any right or provision under this
                      Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

                    purposes, your role (teacher or student) and your school name and

                    Our Service is designed to make it simple for you to store your User
                    Content, collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices to
                    create unique, engaging visuals (“Interactive contents”). To make that
                    possible, we store, process, and transmit your User Content as well as
                    information related to it. This related information includes your
                    profile information, which makes it easier to collaborate and share
                    your User Content with others, as well as things like the size of the
                    file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity. Our
                    Service provides you with different options for sharing your User
                    Content. You may provide us with information about you in draft and
                    published User Content (such as for your Interactive contents). For
                    example, if you create an Interactive content that includes biographic
                    information about you or someone else, we will have that information,
                    and so will anyone with access to that Interactive content if you
                    choose to publish the Interactive content publicly. We process the
                    User Content as our customers’ service provider and in the role of
                    data processor. This data is processed for purposes decided and
                    controlled by one of our organizational customers. Therefore, such
                    personal data shall not be within the scope of this Privacy Policy.

                      information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically
                      make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device

                      of access, operating system, and mobile network information. Your
                      devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit approximate
                      location information to the Services, based on the location of your
                      IP address. We collect log information when you use our Service, for

                      editing, viewing, and moving files or folders). We use this

                      information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our
                      Service from certain geographic regions. We may also collect
                      information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when,
                      for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you
                      allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s
                      permissions. We do not track your location.

                      Service. A cookie is a small text file containing a string of
                      alphanumeric characters that may uniquely identify your browser that
                      lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through
                      the Service. A cookie may also convey information to us about how
                      you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click,
                      how frequently you access the Service, and other actions you take on
                      the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over
                      time. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may
                      limit your ability to use the Service. Similarly, we may employ
                      clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously
                      track your usage patterns on the Service, or place clear gifs in
                      HTML-based emails we send you to track which emails are opened and
                      which links you click. This information allows for more accurate
                      reporting and improvement of the Service. For a detailed listing of

                      other basic profile information) via the authorization procedures
                      used by that service. The information we receive depends on which

                      receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who

                      marketing messages to groups of our Users (for example, those who
                      have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain
                      length of time), to serve relevant product marketing. For the
                      purposes of this Privacy Policy, product marketing means product
                      notifications, updates and examples of use or community messages.
                      When we process personal data for the purposes of targeting product

                    Tapybl does not verify the accuracy of the personal data you provide.
                    All Tapybl profiles are typically made available to the public,
                    however you may elect to make your content private. If you make all of
                    the content on your profile private, then your profile will not appear
                    in a directory search of the Service, but a user may still be able to
                    access your profile if they know the uniform resource locator (URL)
                    address for your profile. For our student users, this profile data is
                    displayed only to users belonging to the same organization. You can
                    edit and change your profile and account data through the Settings of
                    your account. You have the right to inspect the personal data we have
                    stored about you in the Tapybl User Register either via the Service
                    (if we, in our sole discretion, offer such functionality) or by
                    requesting it in writing from Tapybl. You have the right to access and
                    be informed about your personal data processed by us. You may contact
                    us and request a copy of your personal data. You can also choose not
                    to provide the optional account information, profile information, and
                    transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you
                    do not provide this information, certain features of our Services, for
                    example, paid, premium Services, may not be accessible.

                    Content upon request, but please be aware that due to the social

                    safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information
                    we collect and that we share with our service providers. Personal data

                    We do not store your personal data longer than is legally permitted
                    and necessary for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. The storage
                    period depends on the nature of the information and on the purposes of
                    processing. The maximum period may therefore vary per use. When you
                    sign up for an account with us, we’ll retain information you store on

                    we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we
                    will initiate deletion of this information within 30 days of your

                  <p>
                    This Privacy Policy does not govern the collection, use, or disclosure
                    of personal information through the Service by the educational
                    institution or organization which has given you (or your child) access

                  <p><strong>Processing of data regarding children</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    In some instances, children may use the Service and personal data of
                    children may be collected to the Service. We take many special
                    precautions to protect the privacy of children under 13. Children may
                    only access the Services at the direction of their teacher or school
                    district when their teacher or school has subscribed to the Service
                    and enabled the option for their students to join the Service. In this
                    case, the school or another institute shall be a data controller and
                    shall be responsible for the processing of personal data, including
                    the collection of parental consents when necessary. Please see our
                    Kid’s Privacy Policy to learn more about how we protect the privacy of
                    our users who are under 13 years of age.

                  <p><strong>Transferring your data</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Because the Services are offered worldwide, the information about you
                    that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used,
                    stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European
                    Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of
                    companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the
                    purposes listed in the What We Collect and Why section above. When
                    providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will
                    take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your
                    personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy
                    as required by applicable law. These measures include, in the case of
                    entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into
                    European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with
                    them, unless Tapybl has adopted an alternative method other than the
                    Standard Contract Clauses, that ensures an adequate level of
                    protection of personal data in a third country.

                  <p>
                    We recognize that from time to time we may have children under 13 use
                    the site under the supervision of a parent or an educational
                    institution acting as an agent of their parent. When that happens, we
                    take additional precautions to protect the privacy of children under
                    13. This Kid’s Privacy Policy is designed to inform how we process
                    personal data of children, in addition to the information provided in
                    our general Privacy Policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In case the User considers our processing of personal data to be
                    inconsistent with the applicable data protection laws, a complaint may
                    be lodged with the local supervisory authority for data protection.

                  <p>
                    When a user creates a Tapybl account, we may ask for name, email
                    address, a description of your role when using the Service, and
                    password and a birth date. Children may only access the Services at
                    the direction of their teacher or school district when their teacher
                    or school has subscribed to the Service and enabled the option for
                    their students to join the Service. In this case, the school or
                    another institute shall be a data controller and shall be responsible
                    for the processing of personal data, including the collection of

                    We automatically collect certain types of usage information when a kid
                    uses our Service. For example, we may collect an IP address, browser
                    type, information about the kid’s mobile device, and other
                    information. This data is collected using technologies such as
                    cookies, web beacons and other unique identifiers. This information
                    may be collected by Tapybl or by third parties. To learn more about
                    this type of data, see “What is collected and why” in our general

                    that the kid will not have to re-enter it during a later visit;
                    provide custom, personalized content, monitor site analytics, and
                    improve our service. We do not permit third party behavioral
                    advertising on our site. We do not target any advertisements or
                    product marketing to children. Kids will not receive any marketing or
                    promotional messages via our Service, as long as they have signed up
                    for a correct account type, i.e. if they have signed up as a student.

                    <strong>How we use and share information collected from kids.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We use this information to operate, maintain and provide the
                    functionality of the Service and to communicate with the kid and the
                    parent about activities on the Service. We may also send
                    Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes or updates
                    to features of the Service, technical and security notices).
                    Registered users cannot opt-out of Service-related emails.

                  <p>
                    Our Service generally permits users to connect with others on the
                    Service and to share information with others. Members under 13 have
                    restricted sharing capabilities, though a kid under 13 may be
                    permitted to share information in the following manner:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>With the kid’s teacher(s).</li>
                    <li>
                      Kids are able to use some of the sharing functions, but kids under
                      13 are not permitted to share their information publicly on the
                      Service.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In addition, we may share a kid’s personal information with:</p>

                      the personal information in the same way as we can under this

                  <p><strong>Processing of kids’ personal data.</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Where the Service is used by a child for educational purposes, the
                    educational institution decides the purposes and means of processing
                    and therefore acts as a data controller. The educational institution
                    is responsible for the processing of kids’ personal data, including
                    the collection of parental consents and informing the parents. At that
                    time, the kid will be able to participate in the Service as permitted
                    by the educational institution.

                    A registered user can modify personal data or delete a Tapybl account
                    at any time by visiting the “Account settings” page. A parent or child
                    may contact us at any time by emailing us or by contacting us at the
                    address below to review, change, and/or delete any information we have
                    collected from a kid under 13 as well as to disallow any further
                    collection or use of the child’s information. We will take steps to
                    verify the identity of anyone requesting personally identifiable
                    information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the
                    child’s parent or legal guardian. You can also contact the relevant
                    teacher or school organization if you wish to delete the data.

                  <p>
                    Some users of the Service may include young children. We take many
                    special precautions to protect the privacy of children under 13. The
                    Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects children
                    under the age of 16. Children may only access the Services at the
                    direction of their teacher or school district by using an invitation
                    code provided to them by their teacher or educational institution.
                    School officials and teachers are authorized under COPPA to provide
                    consent on behalf of parents; therefore, Tapybl does not obtain
                    parental consent directly from parents of children who are using the
                    Service. A teacher or school district official provides consent for a
                    child under the age of 13 to use the Service when they create an
                    account on the Service for that child. Please see the ‘Tapybl’s Kid’s
                    Privacy Policy’ above to learn more about how we protect the privacy
                    of our users who are under 13 years of age.

                    The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) provides
                    parameters for what is permissible when sharing student information.
                    Tapybl is authorized by schools and districts under the FERPA “school
                    official” exception to receive and use educational data to provide
                    educational services. This data has significant educational value;
                    apart from enabling the creation of accounts with which students
                    access the Service, the data allows teachers to track student activity
                    and assess student performance. This information is used only for
                    academic purposes. We do not collect data for collection’s sake, and
                    access is limited and appropriate. For specific information regarding
                    our data handling practices with regard to student data, please refer
                    to our ‘Kid’s Privacy Policy’ above.

                  <p>
                    The web server providing the webpage can store a cookie on the user’s
                    computer or mobile device. An external web server that manages files
                    included or referenced in the webpage is also able to store cookies.
                    All these cookies are called http header cookies. Another way of
                    storing cookies is through JavaScript code contained or referenced in
                    that page.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Each time the user requests a new page, the web server can receive the
                    values of the cookies it previously set and return the page with
                    content relating to these values. Similarly, JavaScript code can read
                    a cookie belonging to its domain and perform an action accordingly.
                  </p>

                    We use “analytics” cookies, which, in conjunction with our web
                    server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of
                    people visiting our Platform and which parts of our Platform are most
                    popular. This helps us gather feedback so that we can improve our
                    Platform and better serve our users. We do not generally store any
                    personal information that you provide to us in a cookie.

                    We also use “social media” cookies to personalize your interaction
                    with third-party social media Platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,
                    where our Platform uses such features. Such cookies recognize users of
                    these social media sites when you view social media content on our
                    Platform. They also allow you to quickly share content across media,
                    using simple “sharing” buttons.
