                  Welcome to Tapybl.com! Our mission is to provide Tapybl users with
                  innovative, accessible and affordable tools for building visual learning
                  experiences in the cloud. Here we describe how we collect, use, and process
                  your personal information when you use our Service, the types of personal
                  data we process and how you may use your rights as a data subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of our services might be subject to a separate privacy policy. If a
                  separate privacy policy applies to a particular service, we will post it in
                  connection with the service in question.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This Privacy Policy applies to processing of personal data carried out by
                  Tapybl as a data controller. This Privacy Policy does not address and is not
                  applicable to the processing of personal data collected by our
                  organizational customers. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the
                  privacy policies of such third parties.

                <p>
                  We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and
                  protect our Services:
                </p>
                <p>Information You Provide:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>
                  You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must
                  register in order to access most of the features of Service. Depending on
                  how you interact with the Service, we may ask for certain information such
                  as your name (first name, last name), email address, a description of your
                  purpose when using the Service (business or education), your industry if you
                  are using the Service for business purposes, your role (teacher or student)
                  and your school name and school district, if you’re using the Service for
                  educational purposes. Depending on your Settings, some of this personal
                  information may be displayed on your public profile and viewable to others
                  on the Service. You can modify these Settings yourself in the Service.
                  Student accounts and profile data are not public to people outside of the
                  student’s organization. Please note that we process only your direct account
                  information as data controller. We process your personal data collected via
                  the Service and used for educational purposes decided and controlled by one
                  of our organizational customers, in the role of data processor. Therefore,
                  such personal data shall not be within the scope of this Privacy Policy.

                    Optional Profile Information. After you setup your account, Tapybl members
                    may also choose to provide additional information which may be shared with
                    others on the Service or through your public profile, such as your name,
                    email address, nickname or online alias, other Tapybl accounts you choose
                    to follow, Interactive contents (as defined in the Content Information
                    section below), websites, and other information relating to your User
                    Content or your use of the Service. In connection with your use of the
                    Service, we may also collect information created or provided by you, or
                    that we otherwise receive, in connection therewith.

                  <li>Payment and Billing Information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  We also collect credit card or payment information for paid subscriptions.
                  This information will be securely stored with a third party specialized in
                  the handling of such information, such as a credit card payment gateway or
                  other payment vendors. Tapybl does not receive or process your payment card
                  data.

                </ul>
                <p>
                  Our Service is designed to make it simple for you to store your User
                  Content, collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices to create
                  unique, engaging visuals (“Interactive contents”). To make that possible, we
                  store, process, and transmit your User Content as well as information
                  related to it. This related information includes your profile information,
                  which makes it easier to collaborate and share your User Content with
                  others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was
                  uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity. Our Service provides you with
                  different options for sharing your User Content. You may provide us with
                  information about you in draft and published User Content (such as for your
                  Interactive contents). For example, if you create an Interactive content
                  that includes biographic information about you or someone else, we will have
                  that information, and so will anyone with access to that Interactive content
                  if you choose to publish the Interactive content publicly. We process the
                  User Content as our customers’ service provider and in the role of data
                  processor. This data is processed for purposes decided and controlled by one
                  of our organizational customers. Therefore, such personal data shall not be
                  within the scope of this Privacy Policy.

                <p>Information We Collect Automatically:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Device Information. Like most online service providers, we collect
                    information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make
                    available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device
                    identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of
                    access, operating system, and mobile network information. Your devices
                    (depending on their settings) may also transmit approximate location
                    information to the Services, based on the location of your IP address. We
                    collect log information when you use our Service, for example, when you
                    create or make changes to your Interactive contents.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Usage Information. We collect information related to how you use the
                    Service, including actions you take in your account (like sharing,
                    editing, viewing, and moving files or folders). We use this information to
                    improve our Service, develop new services and features, and protect Tapybl
                    users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Location Information. We may determine the approximate location of your
                    device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for
                    example, calculate how many people visit our Service from certain
                    geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise
                    location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph
                    with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile
                    device operating system’s permissions. We do not track your location.

                  <li>
                    Cookies and Similar Technologies. We use technologies like cookies and
                    pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Service. A cookie
                    is a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that
                    may uniquely identify your browser that lets us help you log in faster and
                    enhance your navigation through the Service. A cookie may also convey
                    information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view,
                    the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, and other
                    actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the
                    Service over time. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but
                    this may limit your ability to use the Service. Similarly, we may employ
                    clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track
                    your usage patterns on the Service, or place clear gifs in HTML-based
                    emails we send you to track which emails are opened and which links you
                    click. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement
                    of the Service. For a detailed listing of what cookies we use and how we
                    use them, please read our
                    <u>Cookie Policy</u>.

                  <li>
                    Stored Information: We may access information stored on your mobile device
                    via our mobile app. We access this stored information through your device
                    operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to
                    access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Service
                    may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a photo to the
                    Service to create an Interactive content.

                  <li>
                    Information We Receive from Social Networking Sites. We will allow Users
                    with certain third-party accounts to authenticate on the Service using
                    those third-party accounts. We will also allow Users to share their
                    interactive contents on third party services, such as social networking
                    services provided by others, for example, Facebook. If you create or log
                    into your account on the Service through another third-party service or if
                    you connect your Interactive content on a social media service (like X),
                    we will receive information from that service (such as your username and
                    other basic profile information) via the authorization procedures used by
                    that service. The information we receive depends on which services you
                    authorize and any options that are available. You should always review,
                    and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and
                    services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To provide you the Service, including for example, hosting your
                    Interactive contents and billing you for the Service;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To maintain, monitor, and improve the Service by adding new features,
                    sharing new use cases, or making the Service easier to use;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how you interact with
                    our Service;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For our own internal benchmarking, for example, to measure, and gauge the
                    effectiveness of the Service, our advertising of the Service, and to
                    better understand user retention and attrition – for example, we may
                    analyze how many individuals purchased a plan after receiving a marketing
                    message or the features used by those who continue to use our Service
                    after a certain length of time;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To prevent problems with our Service, protect the security of our Service,
                    detect fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam,
                    and protect the rights and property of Tapybl and others, which may result
                    in us declining a transaction or the use of our Service;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To personalize your experience using our Service, remember your
                    preferences on the Service so that you will not have to re-enter it during
                    your visit or the next time you use the Service, target our marketing
                    messages to groups of our Users (for example, those who have a particular
                    plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), to serve
                    relevant product marketing. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy,
                    product marketing means product notifications, updates and examples of use
                    or community messages. When we process personal data for the purposes of
                    targeting product marketing, we use user groups, and marketing materials
                    are altered depending on the account type. We do not use personal data of
                    students for the purposes of targeted marketing or advertisements; and

                    charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users
                    upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our free

                  and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to

                  elect to make your content private. If you make all of the content on your

                  to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such
                  as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate
                  business interests. We’ll use all commercially reasonable efforts to delete
                  or anonymize your User Content upon request, but please be aware that due to
                  the social nature of our Service, it may not be possible to completely

                  fewer possibilities to use the Services. The withdrawal of consent does not
                  affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

                  Tapybl cares about the security of your information and uses commercially
                  reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to
                  preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that
                  we share with our service providers. Personal data and backups are stored in
                  protected databases located behind a firewall and with both physical and
                  software-based access controls. However, no security system is impenetrable,

                  any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of
                  security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and
                  where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been
                  compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and

                  We do not store your personal data longer than is legally permitted and

                  depends on the nature of the information and on the purposes of processing.
                  The maximum period may therefore vary per use. When you sign up for an

                <p>
                  This Privacy Policy does not govern the collection, use, or disclosure of
                  personal information through the Service by the educational institution or

                <p><strong>Processing of data regarding children</strong></p>
                <p>
                  In some instances, children may use the Service and personal data of
                  children may be collected to the Service. We take many special precautions
                  to protect the privacy of children under 13. Children may only access the
                  Services at the direction of their teacher or school district when their
                  teacher or school has subscribed to the Service and enabled the option for
                  their students to join the Service. In this case, the school or another
                  institute shall be a data controller and shall be responsible for the
                  processing of personal data, including the collection of parental consents
                  when necessary. Please see our Kid’s Privacy Policy to learn more about how
                  we protect the privacy of our users who are under 13 years of age.

                <p><strong>Transferring your data</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Because the Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that
                  we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or
                  accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA)
                  who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party
                  data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the What We
                  Collect and Why section above. When providing information about you to
                  entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that
                  the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance
                  with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures
                  include, in the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA,
                  entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements
                  with them, unless Tapybl has adopted an alternative method other than the
                  Standard Contract Clauses, that ensures an adequate level of protection of
                  personal data in a third country.

                <p><strong>Tapybl’s Kid’s Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We recognize that from time to time we may have children under 13 use the
                  site under the supervision of a parent or an educational institution acting
                  as an agent of their parent. When that happens, we take additional
                  precautions to protect the privacy of children under 13. This Kid’s Privacy
                  Policy is designed to inform how we process personal data of children, in
                  addition to the information provided in our general Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In case the User considers our processing of personal data to be
                  inconsistent with the applicable data protection laws, a complaint may be
                  lodged with the local supervisory authority for data protection.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Personal Information we collect from kids under 13.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  When a user creates a Tapybl account, we may ask for name, email address, a
                  description of your role when using the Service, and password and a birth
                  date. Children may only access the Services at the direction of their
                  teacher or school district when their teacher or school has subscribed to
                  the Service and enabled the option for their students to join the Service.
                  In this case, the school or another institute shall be a data controller and
                  shall be responsible for the processing of personal data, including the
                  collection of parental consents when necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Information collected through cookies and other technology.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We automatically collect certain types of usage information when a kid uses
                  our Service. For example, we may collect an IP address, browser type,
                  information about the kid’s mobile device, and other information. This data
                  is collected using technologies such as cookies, web beacons and other
                  unique identifiers. This information may be collected by Tapybl or by third
                  parties. To learn more about this type of data, see “What is collected and
                  why” in our general Privacy Policy. We use this information to remember
                  information so that the kid will not have to re-enter it during a later
                  visit; provide custom, personalized content, monitor site analytics, and
                  improve our service. We do not permit third party behavioral advertising on
                  our site. We do not target any advertisements or product marketing to
                  children. Kids will not receive any marketing or promotional messages via
                  our Service, as long as they have signed up for a correct account type, i.e.
                  if they have signed up as a student.

                <p>
                  <strong>How we use and share information collected from kids.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use this information to operate, maintain and provide the functionality
                  of the Service and to communicate with the kid and the parent about
                  activities on the Service. We may also send Service-related emails (e.g.,
                  account verification, changes or updates to features of the Service,
                  technical and security notices). Registered users cannot opt-out of
                  Service-related emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our Service generally permits users to connect with others on the Service
                  and to share information with others. Members under 13 have restricted
                  sharing capabilities, though a kid under 13 may be permitted to share
                  information in the following manner:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>With the kid’s teacher(s).</li>
                  <li>
                    Kids are able to use some of the sharing functions, but kids under 13 are
                    not permitted to share their information publicly on the Service.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, we may share a kid’s personal information with:</p>

                <p>
                  Where the Service is used by a child for educational purposes, the
                  educational institution decides the purposes and means of processing and
                  therefore acts as a data controller. The educational institution is
                  responsible for the processing of kids’ personal data, including the
                  collection of parental consents and informing the parents. At that time, the
                  kid will be able to participate in the Service as permitted by the
                  educational institution.

                  A registered user can modify personal data or delete a Tapybl account at any

                  review, change, and/or delete any information we have collected from a kid
                  under 13 as well as to disallow any further collection or use of the child’s
                  information. We will take steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting
                  personally identifiable information about a child and to ensure that the
                  person is in fact the child’s parent or legal guardian. You can also contact

                <p><strong>COPPA compliance</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Some users of the Service may include young children. We take many special
                  precautions to protect the privacy of children under 13. The Children’s
                  Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects children under the age of 16.
                  Children may only access the Services at the direction of their teacher or
                  school district by using an invitation code provided to them by their
                  teacher or educational institution. School officials and teachers are
                  authorized under COPPA to provide consent on behalf of parents; therefore,
                  Tapybl does not obtain parental consent directly from parents of children
                  who are using the Service. A teacher or school district official provides
                  consent for a child under the age of 13 to use the Service when they create
                  an account on the Service for that child. Please see the ‘Tapybl’s Kid’s
                  Privacy Policy’ above to learn more about how we protect the privacy of our
                  users who are under 13 years of age.

                  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) provides parameters
                  for what is permissible when sharing student information. Tapybl is
                  authorized by schools and districts under the FERPA “school official”
                  exception to receive and use educational data to provide educational
                  services. This data has significant educational value; apart from enabling
                  the creation of accounts with which students access the Service, the data
                  allows teachers to track student activity and assess student performance.
                  This information is used only for academic purposes. We do not collect data
                  for collection’s sake, and access is limited and appropriate. For specific
                  information regarding our data handling practices with regard to student
                  data, please refer to our ‘Kid’s Privacy Policy’ above.
